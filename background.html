                <h1>TINA DABI</h1>
                 <p>
                      The story of Tina Dabi is also one of deep and complex social change in India that has made her the first ever Dalit girl to top the UPSC examination. As Lok Sabha MP and ex-civil servant Udit Raj tweeted, 
                      this “would not have been possible 40-50 years ago”. Tina’s parents, both from the Engineering Services, do not speak much about this but are not in denial of the enormity of the achievement, either. They are clear that it is the enabling environment created over years, through generations of struggle and grit, that made a Tina Dabi 
                      possible.
                      “It makes clear what removing obstacles and taking away roadblocks and difficulties can do. Cases like these inspire a lot as they are a testament to how meritorious deprived communities can be, and their innate talent shines and cuts through all issues… a sign of great success and possibility for Dalits struggling to break free of their circumstances,” he said.
